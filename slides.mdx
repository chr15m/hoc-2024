# Before we start
### Installing deps

---

# Going all-in on ClojureScript

- what it means
- why?

---

# The Goal
## zero to "hello world"

<Notes>
What we are going to do today is go from nothing to "hello world" using each of the technologies or tools.
</Notes>

# The tools

- nbb
- shadow-cljs (frontend)
- shadow-cljs (full stack)
- squint
- scittle
- sitefox (framework / library)

# Table of tradeoffs

| Tool        | Compiled | Java | Clj data | Frontend | Backend | Reagent |
|-------------|----------|------|----------|----------|---------|---------|
| nbb         |          |      | X        |          | X       | X       |
| shadow-cljs | X        | X    | X        | X        | X       | X       |

| squint      | X        |      |          | X        | X       |         |

<Notes>

* sitefox is a library/framework you can integrate with these
* scittle can now be used on the back-end but it's a niche use-case for e.g. webworkers.
* cherry's provides is a new lightweight cljs variant that compiles to modern JavaScript and integrates well with the existing ecosystem. So far I haven't found a reason to use it over shadow-cljs for my own projects but it may be worth looking into in the future.
